### Shoutout to the Original Creator!!

This script isn’t my original work—big thanks to the creator [falaz](https://sleazyfork.org/zh-CN/users/151832-falazia-draenei)! You can check out the original link here: [https://sleazyfork.org/zh-CN/scripts/390625-modal-image-in-rule](https://sleazyfork.org/zh-CN/scripts/390625-modal-image-in-rule). It looks like the original script is no longer being maintained, though. o(TヘTo)
